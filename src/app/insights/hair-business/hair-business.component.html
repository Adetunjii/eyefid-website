    <h1>WHAT NO WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT STARTING AN HAIR BUSINESS</h1>
    <p>
      The beauty industry is a very large one and apart from competing with
      local retailer you will have to compete with international competitors who
      are offering same product for less price. The hair retail and wig
      production business are a very large one and the market seem to be highly
      saturated. There are so many people into this line of business such that
      it could seem impossible to enter. There are many fake product retailers
      as well as original sellers but the moment customers confirm your
      authenticity, that becomes the start of your business boom. The ease of
      doing the business is almost free but having to manage it requires a lot
      of discipline. You must find your niche i.e., what you can do to be
      successful in your space. Although, it is highly profitable, you must also
      ensure that you are consistent and focused.

    <h1>Why should you go into the hair business?</h1>
    <p>
      While profit maximization appears to be the main focus for many
      entrepreneurs, it is very important that you have a keen interest in the
      beauty industry particularly in the hairline business. you must love hairs
      so that when things are not going as expected, the love for hairs will
      keep you afloat. so instead of just loving hair you can turn it a passion
      for business. the truth is No market is saturated. It may seem like it but
      it is only from the standpoint with which you are looking at it. You must
      bear in mind that, because a person sells hair to everyone you have in
      your network does not mean they won’t buy from you. You just need to give
      them a good reason through your unique sales and business strategy.

      What form of training should you undergo before starting a Hair business?
    </h1>
    <p>
      No, you don’t need any form of training but the willingness to learn and
      the appetite for research to know what is in demand. We are in an era
      where the internet has leveled the playing field for every one doing
      business. All you need to do is to look up some brands that are doing the
      same business and use their actions to benchmark your business, to do
      better than them. You must be observant; you must also monitor and
      evaluate their performance and progress and with all that you learn you
      would be sure if you too can do it.

    <h1>Some challenges you may face when starting a Hair business.</h1>

    <p>
      Your interest and excitement about hairs should make you fall in love with
      the business. Hence you must be ready for the challenges to come. In the
      start, you may not get any patronage even from close network that must
      have encouraged you to start the business. You will still find your
      friends buying from other hair vendors but that should not discourage you.
      You can’t expect people to believe in you if you don’t believe in
      yourself. Your confidence about your product is import to take you up a
      step on the ladder. You need to have solid customer relations because
      majority of your customers will be impatient and that could frustrate you
      to act in ways that could make you lose customers for the business. you
      will need to work twice as hard and become your own ambassador to get
      customers. In running a hair business, you can’t be far from it because
      people want to see the face behind it. They want to know if they can trust
      you. Furthermore, you need business and money management ability otherwise
      you will end up mixing up your personal money with your business income
      which is tantamount to ruining your business in the short while. Also, not
      being able to sort money could make you confuse sales for profit. You need
      to know how to work well under pressure and be calm when your customers
      are angry. You must focus on the end game of allowing them buy from you
      and deliver exactly what they buy from you.

    <h1>Winning customers trust as a hair vendor</h1>

    <p>
      You simply have to create your own standard; it is not easy but you must
      keep trying. You must be consistent because you can’t escape the hard
      times. One of the things you must do to win your customers and earn their
      loyalty is by supplying exactly what they ordered. Many people want to be
      faster than the process and end up putting up a very expensive hair online
      and delivering the replica with lower quality. To the vendor they may feel
      fulfilled but it will create a lasting dent on the brand and block access
      to future revenue. The sad part is that these vendors blame the customers
      for their greed forgetting that everyone is looking for the best deal.
      Many customers know that the price the vendor is setting for the hair is
      unreasonable yet they go ahead to continue with the purchase and end up
      disappointed yet you can’t blame them.

    <h1>What advice will you give to someone going into this hair business?</h1>
    <p>
      My advice would be that you ask yourself if you are truly interested in
      the business. You must have passion for the business because you may not
      make money immediately. If you are going into the business with sole aim
      of maximizing profit at the early stage you will be frustrated and lose
      interest. When you have both passion and interest even if you are not
      making sales at the first stage of business, your passion and interest
      will keep you going.

    <h1>What budget is required to get into the hair business?</h1>
    <p>
      I started with zero capital. I started with posting just pictures and
      videos so when I got orders, I get the supply from a trusted vendor and
      distribute. I could have bought hair to resell when I started making money
      but I also knew it was going to tie down capital which was not good for a
      new business with minimum capital sources. Depending on the quality of
      hair it is really not advisable to buy hair when sales are not guaranteed
      on them. It doesn’t require capital except you have an existing market
      that you wish to satisfy.
