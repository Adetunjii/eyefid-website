    <h1>How to rake profit from the booming body enhancement industry</h1>
    <p>
      Sales of body fitness, body enhancement and sex products ranging from flat
      tommy, breast and butt enhancement products and sex enhancement product
      has become the order of the day. These products which falls under the
      beauty and health category has taken a boom in the market. It is true that
      no business is 100% easy to start and this is one of them, there will be
      times where you won’t have customers for a long period of time and it
      could discourage you out of business especially for the beauty and health
      product where people have had experiences with acclaimed effective
      products which ended up disappointing them. The industry indeed looks rosy
      from the outside but it requires a lot of hard work and consistency even
      if it seems like nothing is working. Starting off I had just two (2)
      clients which was a close friend and someone else who heard about our
      product.

      Why you should go into the Beauty and health enhancement product industry.
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you have tried other kinds of businesses which didn’t work out then
      this is one which you be looking to try out. At the initial stage you may
      discover that you aren’t passionate about it and for that reason you are
      likely to be inconsistent which could lead to the short life expectancy of
      the business. No one does it alone, in an interview with a successful
      vendor she narrated “I met with my partner and we brainstormed on what we
      could do to solve people’s pain point since the other businesses were not
      working out. So, I started with selling infection cure drinks and grew
      into beauty enhancement products. My goal was to boost women confidence
      after finding the truth that many women want to look better, they want to
      be praised by their look. This pain point was the turning point for me.”

    <h1>What form of training should you undergo?</h1>
    <p>
      Beauty and health are critical aspects of people’s life, but is sad to see
      that many people go into this business based on intuition or trial by
      error and put a dent to the overall industry image. It is important to
      enroll for a beauty enhancement production training to learn the effect of
      various ingredients in order not to create a disaster. However, in
      marketing these products you don’t necessarily have to attend any training
      because you would have to create your own style. In this same interview,
      it was revealed that “Many of the things I know today was self-taught from
      the internet to asking questions from those already in the business and
      also learning from their experience. I didn’t have a mentor but I had
      people I benchmarked myself with. I looked up to them as a role model but
      didn’t have any personal mentorship from them. I watched closely at some
      kind of people who were just doing their thing and I learnt from how they
      started to where they are now and I realized that nothing can beat that
      aside from consistency and hard work. On the other hand, it helped me in
      believing more in myself then I found my self growing from one client to
      ten to twenty… you know the rest. The more I kept at it the more people
      came looking for me.”

      Some challenges you may face when running a beauty and health enhancement
      business
    </h1>

    <p>
      Being an emerging sector, we needed to get authentic information of the
      key challenges and the fitness guru shared from her point of experience
      saying, “I learned that consistency was all I needed to move the business
      forward and to trust God. There were times where I felt like quitting, I
      wasn’t getting customers because people believed that as a seller of
      fitness and body enhancement products, I needed to look the talk. They
      failed to believe that it was a choice for me. I never wanted big breast,
      I was fine with my flat tummy and big butt. However, customers appear to
      always be right so I had to take my product to have a big breast to please
      my customers it was after this that I experienced a turnaround in
      business. I had to sacrifice my choice for my look for the greater good of
      running a successful business. People want to see proof and if that’s what
      it takes let them have it.
    </p>

    <p>
      My other experience was with Logistics companies misplacing my products
      which were sent to clients and I had to bear the cost of replacing them
      and paying for another delivery. I also had to deal with clients that were
      expecting instant result for a product that requires at least 2 weeks to
      show obvious differences and they immediately conclude that it is not
      working. There were just too many pressures. It took me a year to figure
      things out without a mentor. I made mistakes and had the willingness to
      learn more and become a better person.

    <h1>
      What advice would you give a person going into a Beauty and health
      business
    </h1>

    <p>
      The first thing I will say is “SELL YOUR SHAME”. It is not an easy one.
      You will get a lot for critics such as who are you to recreate what God
      has already created. No one will feed you and you must ignore those
      telling you that body enhancement products are not glorifying. If that was
      true the remedy would not be found on earth. People just want to look good
      and God is not against it. We had a mandate and that was simply to help
      people appreciate themselves more. You have to sell your shame! Don’t take
      everything you hear as critics use it to build up on what you believe in.
      Nothing else matters except what you believe! Be focused, know what you
      want, always remember your why – the reason you started. The minute you
      accept it, there is no going back. You may see some business booming
      really fast then when you enter into it you are not making a single sale
      that’s because no one talks about their struggles but the success which is
      what everyone would want to hear. You don’t know the energy, the
      sacrifices that the person you were looking up to has made for the
      business to get to that level or height. I already spoke of consistency
      and these are the key ingredient to succeed in any business at all not
      just this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do not copy! Be motivated. You can learn from other people’s story but DO
      NOT COPY. Also do not COMPETE just do your thing and focus on your side.

    <h1>What would you say is the key attribute to your business success?</h1>
    <p>
      First of all, your customer service. I will always tell people, the name
      of the business is nothing, the business is the rider, the admin or
      customer relationship officer and how they communicate with your customer.
      They determine the success of the business; they are the people that your
      customers see and interact with. When these people are messed up your
      business is on the bad side. One thing that has helped box2door is that
      customer relationship became top notch and something we could brag about.
      We good excellent feedbacks from most clients. Riders being able to
      deliver at the right time, riders that see the success of the company as
      their successes. Sometimes client give feedbacks such as” your rider was
      really funny today and I want him to make my other deliveries “that was a
      sign he was passionate about delivering value which uplifts the brand
      image.
